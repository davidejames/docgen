# docgen
Generate contextually-customized text-based documents from a configuration
based on a prompt or keyword list.

This is to streamline creation of customized documents from a set of notes.
For example, if you have a bunch of notes on use cases of a tool and notes
of how to complete certain actions, you could generate persona-based help
content.

The documents created are intended to provide a starting point only, not
final copies.

It may be useful to add LLM integration into the process itself for further
refining points from notes. Initial versions will be based solely on simple
text matches and jinja templates to see how these methods perform.
